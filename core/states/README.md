# State Machine
This is where we will define our state machine. The state machine is a what will control the flow of autonomy. The
state machine will be a singleton class. This means that there will only be one instance of the state machine. This is
because we only want one state machine in Autonomy. The state machine will be a finite state machine. This means that the
state machine will have a finite number of states.
